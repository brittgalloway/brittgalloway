# Hi, I'm Brittney!
🌟 Frontend Developer | 🎨 Creative Problem Solver | 💡 UI/UX Enthusiast

I’m a frontend web developer who loves crafting clean, accessible, and performant web experiences. My background in fine art and traditional animation fuels my approach to frontend development—both require planning, iteration, and attention to detail to bring an idea to life.

## About Me

My journey into web development started with building an art portfolio and an ecommerce platform for my sister’s artwork. Along the way, I realized that creating a great website is a lot like animation:

📝 **Sketches & Concepts** → Wireframes & Prototypes <br/>
📖 **Storyboards** → User Flows & Design Systems <br/>
🛠️ **Building the Animation** → Developing Components & Features <br/>
🔎 **Test Screenings** → Debugging & Unit Testing <br/>
🎬 **Final Render** → Deployment & Optimization <br/>

Since 2019, I’ve been developing user-friendly interfaces, improving accessibility, and optimizing performance. I enjoy solving real-world problems with CSS, JavaScript, and native browser technologies, and I’m always looking for ways to write cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Technical Skills
🖥️ **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript (learning), HTML5, (S)CSS <br/>
