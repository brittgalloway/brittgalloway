# Hi, I'm Brittney!
ðŸŒŸ Problem solver ðŸŒŸ Creative Thinker ðŸŒŸ Collaborative Team Member ðŸŒŸ

 I'm Brittney Galloway, a frontend web developer focusing on user interfaces and experiences.

## About Me

With a background in fine art and traditional animation, I love blending technology and art. I'm always making something. My journey into web development began with the desire to create an art portfolio (to house art, comics, and animation) and an ecommerce platform for my sister's art. Along the way, I've discovered that the steps to creating an animation and a website share similarities:
1. Sketches for concept/flow
2. Storyboards/wireframes
3. Planning/choosing tools and frameworks
4. Development
5. QA/test screenings
6. Go live/Final render

Since 2019, I have gained progressive experience in designing and developing the layout, visual design, and interactive elements of applications. I thrive on the technical challenges that come with creating intuitive websites. I am a problem solver, a creative thinker, and a collaborative team member. I love finding solutions to practical problems.
